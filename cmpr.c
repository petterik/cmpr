Below we have shell functions which we used for building in the first days of the project.
These can gradually be cleaned up as we implement the functionality directly or in other ways.
We export these functions into a separate file so that they can be sourced at the shell.
e.g. `. cmpr/functions.sh` brings the current functions into scope.
Then we use `build` to do a build, and so on.

In main,

First we call init_spans, since all our i/o relies on it.

We call projfiles_arena_alloc near the top and and _free before we exit, with room for 1 << 14 (2^14) elements.

We call span_arena_alloc(), and at the end we call span_arena_free() just for clarity even though it doesn't matter anyway since we're exiting the process.
We allocate a spans arena of 1 << 20 or a binary million spans.

Just above main, we declare a global ui_state* called state, which will allow us to not pass around the ui_state singleton all over our program.
After declaring our ui_state variable in main, which we initialize to {0}, we will set this global pointer to it.
We set config_file_path on the state to the default configuration file path which is ".cmpr/conf", i.e. always relative to the CWD.
We projfiles_alloc room for 1024 files on the state, and set the ".n" to zero, so we can use the _push() pattern.

We call a function handle_args to handle argc and argv.
This function will also read our config file (if any).
We call check_conf_vars() once after this; we also call it in the main loop but we need it before trying to get the code.

Next we call a function get_code().
This function either handles reading standard input or if we are in "project directory" mode then it reads the files indicated by our config file.
In either case, once this returns, inp is populated and any other initial code indexing work is done.

Then we call main_loop().

The main loop reads input in a loop and probably won't return, but just in case, we always call flush() before we return so that our buffered output from prt and friends will be flushed to stdout.

In handle_args we handle any command-line arguments.

If "--conf <alternate-config-file>" is passed, we update config_file_path on the state.
Once we know the conf file to read from, we call parse_config before we do anything else.

If "--print-conf" is passed in, we print our configuration settings and exit.
This is only OK to write because we have already called parse_config, so the configuration settings have already been read in from the file.
In other words, this function will always call parse_config, always before printing the config if "--print-conf" is used, and always after updating the config file if "--conf" is used.
We do this by setting an indicator print_conf while parsing the flags, and then printing the conf at the end; this handles both the case where both flags are used together and the case where just --print-conf is used with the default conf file.

With the "--help" flag we just prt a short usage summary and exit_success().
We include argv[0] as usual and indicate that typical usage is by providing a project directory as the argument, and summarize all the flags that we support.

With "--init" we call a function, cmpr_init(), which performs some initialization of a new directory to be used with the tool.

With "--version" we print the version number.
(The version is always a natural number, and goes up when a release significantly increases usability.
Here we use "Version: $VERSION$" and the dollar-delimited variable-looking thing is replaced by a build step.)

In find_blocks_by_type_python, we get a span containing a file.

We write two loops.
In the first one we count the blocks, then we spans_alloc our return value with the correct number, and in the second loop we assign the spans.

For a Python file, a block starts with triple double-quote at the beginning of a line.
It contains another triple double-quote at the beginning of a line somewhere in the middle of the block, ending the comment part, which we must skip over.
It ends where the next block starts (true for all blocks regardless of language).

There are some special cases:

If the file is empty, we return a single empty block.

If a file does not begin with the triple quote, then the first block will just be from the beginning of the file to the second triple quote at the beginning of a line.

The last block always goes to the end of the file.

Before the first loop we copy our argument into a new span `copy` so that we can consume it while counting, but then still have access to the original full span for the second loop.

The block-finding loop:
- While the remaining input is not empty, we get the next line. (Note that next_line will return everything left if there is no newline).
- If this line starts with the pattern, or if it is the first line in the file, then it begins a block (regardless of whether the line is empty), otherwise we simply do nothing and continue the loop. (If it starts with the pattern and we have seen an odd number of them so far, then we skip it because the pattern appears two times in each Python block.)
- If we are counting blocks, we increment our counter, otherwise we assign .buf of a span for this block, and if we had a previous block, we assign .end of that block to the same offset.
- When we reach the end of the input we will assign .end of the last block to the end of the input.

(To determine if we are at the start of the input, we can compare .buf of the line with that of the input.)

At the end of the function, we ensure with a simple loop, that all the blocks returned together tile the file, and that none are empty.
This means:
The first block begins where our input span begins.
The last block ends where our input ends.
If either of these conditions fails, the sanity test fails.
For every other block, .buf is equal to the .end of the previous.
If this sanity check fails, we complain and crash as usual (prt, flush, exit).

In find_blocks_by_type_c, we get a span containing a file.

We write two loops.
In the first one we count the blocks, then we spans_alloc our return value with the correct number, and in the second loop we assign the spans.

For a C file, a block starts with the slash-star pattern at the beginning of a line.
It ends where the next block starts.

There are some special cases:

If the file is empty, we return a single empty block.
We handle this as a special case, since it doesn't really work with our two-loop approach.
We also care about where the blocks are, even if they are empty, so in this case we ensure that the empty block we return is the same as the empty span of the file itself (i.e. .buf and .end are equal to each other, and to those of the file: we can NOT use nullspan() here).

If a file does not begin with a block comment, then the first block will just be from the beginning of the file to the first block comment.

The last block always goes to the end of the file.

Before the first loop we copy our argument into a new span `copy` so that we can consume it while counting, but then still have access to the original full span for the second loop.

The block-finding loop:
- While the remaining input is not empty, we get the next line. (Note that next_line will return everything left if there is no newline).

/* span count_physical_lines(span, int*)

In this function we are given a span and a (pointer to a) maximum number of physical lines to print or count.

The span may be of arbitrary length, which is why we do not simply count the lines in the span; we do not want unbounded runtime.

Definitions:
A logical line is an actual line terminated by newline or by the end of the span.
A physical line is a row of terminal output, which is reached either when terminal_cols characters of output reaches the end of the line, causing wrapping, or when a literal newline is printed (or both).
The physical line is defined such that after printing a physical line (starting at the beginning of a terminal row), the next character printed to the terminal will appear on the subsequent terminal row.

We begin counting physical lines off of the input span according to this definition.
Specifically, we count off either terminal_cols chars, followed by a newline (which will have no effect if it comes after exactly that many chars, i.e. after counting off terminal_cols chars, we need to check if the *next* char is a newline, because if it is we should skip over it), or we count off a shorter line followed by an actual newline.

We decrement the int of remaining lines each time we have counted off a physical line.
Our return value is the span of physical lines that we have counted off.
The int will go to zero if the span passed in is long enough, otherwise the span returned will contain the entire input and the int may remain positive.

(The intended typical use of this function is to provide a span and a desired number of physical lines of terminal space to occupy, then to print the returned span, and perhaps to prepare a suffix of the original span to keep printing, and perhaps to use the int to track remaining lines of terminal output to fill or similar.)

(Note: I don't think the below is correct when a logical line has exactly terminal_cols chars in it, however I don't want to iterate further or test right now.)

/* page_down() and page_up()

Here we implement dual functions that handle pagination within the current block.

We define content_rows as the number of terminal_rows minus two, since we always have a header line and a ruler line reserved at the top and bottom of the screen resp.

We simply increment or decrement state->scrolled_lines by content_rows, except that we always want to fill the screen.
For example, if a block has 23 physical lines and the terminal has 24 rows, then our content area is 22 rows, and when we paginate downwards we will show the last 22 lines of content (skipping only the first line).
Redrawing is handled in the main loop, so all we do here is update scrolled_lines as needed, returning void.

If we are already scrolled to the bottom, scrolling down will have no effect (similarly if scrolled_lines = 0 for scrolling up).

We have a helper function (count_physical_lines) that counts physical lines up to a maximum.
It updates the int passed to it by reference to indicate the remaining number of lines (<= the maximum before the call) that have not been printed (will only be non-zero if the block was short of content).
In page_down, we first call this with scrolled_lines and get a span back which is the part that is already "scrolled off" the top of the screen as the return value.

We make a copy of the block (blocks indexed by current_block, both on state).
We update .buf of this copy to the .end of the scrolled-off part, thus getting the part of the block currently visible on the screen as well as anything "below" the screen.

We then call the helper function again on this remainder content with terminal_rows as the number, to get the number of lines occupied by the currently displayed content, up to a full screen's worth.
If there is less than one full screen's worth currently displayed, then we reduce scrolled_lines by the remaining number, so that the screen becomes full.

(Note that as count_physical_lines decrements the remaining physical lines to print while it is counting off lines, we need to subtract to get the actual number of physical lines of content that would be printed.)

Otherwise, we increase scrolled_lines by a full screenfull, and then we call the helper function a third time.
Now, again, we can check if it will print a full screenfull, and if not, we can again reduce scrolled_lines such that the result will be a full screen of content ending with the last physical line of the block.

The page_up function is a bit simpler, as we can always unconditionally scroll up by a full page of lines, so we simply decrease scrolled_lines by a screenful (with a minimum of zero, obviously).

First we identify the logical lines by finding the newlines in the block, and we store the offset of each (as an offset from .buf on the block).
We find out how many "physical" lines (i.e. terminal rows) each logical line uses by taking the ceil of quotient of line length by terminal cols.

Then we decide, based on the number of blocks, the layout information, and the terminal dimensions, how many lines from each we can fit on the screen.
For this we declare a separate helper function which we will write later.

/* #printsingle

In printsingle, we get the ui state and a limit of lines to print.
We call printsinglehelper(), which takes:

- the ui state,
- a max number of lines to print phy_row_lim,
- a number of lines to skip phy_row_off,
- an indicator (1) to print or (0) to count the lines,
- an indicator (1) to split or (0) favor the 
- the address of a decrement counter for lines remaining (non-negative),
- the address of a span of unprinted input.

We call an offset (the number of rows to skip) perfect if it perfectly fills the limit, which means that a call to the helper sends the lines remaining to zero and the len of unprinted input to zero on the same call.
In the helper, if 

The limit must always be less than or equal to state.terminal_rows, otherwise it will be ignored, since we are a paging output mode.
The block to print from is given by the second argument, always a zero-based integer < state->blocks.n.

If we are in splitting mode, then we first need to determine whether we have more than

Specifically:

- block_row_limit sets a hard limit of vertical lines to be occupied by the printing of the block
- block_row_offset skips a number of vertical lines of the block before it begins printing at the beginning of a (physical) line.

The caller sets block_row_limit to a desired limit before the call to this function.
If block_row_limit is zero, we return 0 (the number of lines we have successfully printed, as always).
If it is negative we prt() a short complaint with newline and exit_failure().

We copy the block into a local span for convenience.

In our first loop, we count physical lines until we know that we have skipped block_row_offset lines.
We perform this by calling a function, span decrement_physical_skip(int*,int,span), described later.
The arguments to this function are, in order, the address of block_row_limit, terminal_cols, and our copy of the block, and we assign the return value back to our copy of the block as the block copy always contains data not yet printed (or in this loop, skipped).
If the len() of the remaining block contents goes to zero in this loop, then we return zero.

We then skip more physical lines until we know whether we can overfill block_row_limit.

If the number of physical lines printed equals the block_row_limit, and the block_row_limit was positive, we can say the offset is "perfect".

/* #handle_keystroke

In handle_keystroke, we support the following single-char inputs:

- j/k Go up or down one block. If we are at the first or last block, these are no-ops.
- g/G Go to the first or last block resp.
- e, Edit the current block in $EDITOR (or vi by default)
- r, Request an LLM rewrite the code part of the block based on the comment part; silently updates clipboard
- R, kin to "r", which reads current clipboard contents back into the block, replacing the code part
- space/b, paginate down or ("back") up within a block
- B, do a build by running the build command you provide
- v, sets the marked point to the current index, switching to "visual" selection mode, or leaves visual mode if in it
- /, switches to search mode
- S, (likely to change) goes into settings mode
- ?, display brief help about the keyboard shortcuts available
- q, exits (with prt("goodbye\n"); flush(); exit(0))

We split out j/k and g/G onto their own lines though.
Include all relevant details about usage that might be non-obvious, e.g.:
- r "puts a prompt on the clipboard to rewrite the code part based on comment part"
Include mnemonic hints where given (e.g. "back" for b).

/*
To support search mode, we have a static buffer of length 256 which can be used to search and which the user types into when in search mode.

In start_search(), to indicate that we are in search mode, we set the search on the ui state to be equal to a span which points at this static buffer.
And we set the span to contain the slash "/" that was typed.
We can do this using S(), but we prefer to just directly construct the span.
When we first go into search mode, we point the span at the start of the static buffer, we make it length 1 and the static buffer always starts with slash.

Then we enter our own loop where we call getch and handle basic line editing.
On any backspace character we will simply shorten the span (.end--) and on any other input at all we will extend it.
However, if we've deleted the initial slash, that means the user doesn't want to be in search mode any more.
Therefore, if the search span on the ui state has zero length, this means search mode is off.
So after every backspace, if the search span length goes to zero then we call print_current_blocks() to update the display and then return.

Every time the contents of the line changes, or when we first enter search mode, we will call another function, perform_search.
This will implement search and also displays the search results and indicates that we're in search mode to the user.
If we hit enter, we call another helper to finish the search successfully.

- perform_search()
- finalize_search()

In perform_search(), we get the state after the search string has been updated.

The search string (span state.search) will always start with a slash.
We remove this (there is no library method for this so just directly construct the span) and take the rest of it as the actual string to search for.
We iterate through the blocks and use spanspan to find the first block that matches, along with the number of other blocks that match.
If the search span is empty (as when only "/" was typed) then we match every block, so we can use empty() on the result of spanspan to detect a match, but we also match if the search span is empty().
(This will store the empty span at the beginning of the first block as the match span, which gives the behavior we want when printing the match later.)
We store both the index of the first block that matched and a copy of the span given by spanspan for this first block only, as we will need both of them later.

This tells us where the first block was that matched, and how many total blocks matched, and also the location in the span that contains the match.

Once we have our search results, we call clear_display().

Also at the top, we declare a local variable of remaining lines from the top of the terminal window, since we want to print something at the bottom later.
Every time we print a line or multiple lines, we decrement this value with the number of lines we printed, no more and no less.
In particular, we never decrement this "in advance," for lines to printed later, as that would violate the invariant that the number of actual remaining lines is the number in our variable.

Next, we print "Block N:" on a line (adding one as usual).
Then we decide how many initial lines of the block to print.
Without changing the terminal lines remaining value (since we indeed want our last line to be on the last line) we subtract 8 from this remaining number (leaving space for other output) and divide this by two to get the number of initial block physical lines to print.
Then we print this many physical lines of the block, by calling a function print_physical_lines(span,int).
(Note: physical lines means terminal rows used, as opposed to logical lines actually ending in newline.)

If nothing matched, then we do not print this part, but we still print the "N blocks matched" part later (0 in that case, of course) and the search string itself on the last line.

After the first lines of the block, we print a blank line, then "Match:" on a line, and then the line that contains the matched span.
We call a helper function, print_matching_physical_lines, which takes the block and the actual matched span (which we have from before), and handles finding and printing the match, and returns the number of physical lines that it used.

We print another blank line and then "N blocks matched".

Finally, we will add empty lines until we are at the bottom of the screen as indicated by terminal_rows on the state.
On the last line we will print the entire search string (including the slash).
(We can do this with wrs(), we don't need to add a newline as we are already on the last line of the window anyway.)
Before returning from the function we call flush() as we are responsible for updating the display.

/* Settings.

When the tool starts, we ask about specific configuration settings that must exist.
Otherwise, for settings like the buildcmd we only ask the first time the feature is used.

As settings are changed, we write a configuration file, which is always .cmpr/conf in the current working directory.

The contents of this file will be similar to RFC822-style headers.
We will have a key name followed by colon, space and then a value to the end of the line.

We have functions to read and write this format, which we do in the cmp space.

In handle_conf_{language,file} we are called with a span in each case containing either a pathname or a language, in the order that these config keys occur in the config file.

The idea is that when a language key occurs, it sets the language which is then used on subsequent files.
However, as the one exception to this pattern, when files are included before any language is given, then we will add the files without a language.

Therefore:

- when we see a language line, we will set the current_language on the state
- when we see a file line, we set the language on the file to current_language and add the file to the state
- only in the case where we see a language line and the language was not already set, then we know that this is the first language line in the file; in this case we iterate over any files that we already added, and set the language on them.

Below we write both functions handle_conf_{language,file}.

In the first function, parse_config, we read the contents of our config file (at state->config_file_path) into the cmp space, parse it, and set on the ui_state all the appropriate values.

We have a library method cmp_compl() which gives us the complement of cmp in cmp_space, which is the space that we can safely read into.
We'll read our configuration file into that space with read_file_S_into_span().

After we read the file into cmp, we get a span back from our library method containing the file contents.
We still have to manually update cmp.end to match the end of this span so that later uses of the cmp space don't clobber our configs.

We then can use next_line() in a loop to process them one by one.
First we look for ":" with find_char, and if it is not found, we skip the line.
After the colon we'll skip any whitespace with an isspace() loop and then consider the rest of the line to be the value.
(Note that we don't trim whitespace off the end, something maybe worth documenting elsewhere for config file users).
Next_line has already stripped the newline from the end so we don't need to do that.

Next, we compare the key part before the colon with our list of configuration values above, and if it matches any of them, we set the corresponding member of the ui state, which is always named the same as the config key name.
The values of the config keys will always be spans.
We have CONFIG_FIELDS defined above, we use that here with an X macro.

However, there is an exception to the handling of config fields for some values that might be handled specially.
These are not included in our CONFIG_FIELDS, but instead we handle them with custom code here.
These are:

- language
- file

These are handled by custom code, so we have functions handle_conf_{language,file} (already written above) that we call with the value span for either of these each time they occur in the config file.

Therefore, we maintain a local variable indicating the last-written language, initially empty of course.

The essential configuration variables, along with the reason why each is required, are:

revdir: We save a revision every time you edit a block, this is where they will be stored (.cmpr/revs is a good choice).
tmpdir: Location for temporary files for editing a block in the editor, a good choice is .cmpr/tmp.

TODO: probably all the above "config-related metadata" should be in one place in a table for all the conf vars; we'll do that later.
For now, a local macro cleans up this code quite a bit.

For each missing variable in the order given, we print the string after the colon above as a prompt to the user (and include the configuration parameter name).

We then call read_line to get the new value from the user.
For the buffer space to use we will first call cmp_compl() to get the complement of cmp space as a span.
After read_line returns we will always set cmp.end to point to the end of the RETURNED span; this makes sure nothing else uses that space later.
NOTE: THIS MEANS THE VALUE THAT IS ****RETURNED**** BY THE READ_LINE FUNCTION.

Additional to the "normal" conf vars, we also have the files, and the language setting for each file.

First, it's a requirement that there be at least one file, even if it is empty, otherwise we have nowhere to put any blocks and no way to get things off the ground.
Therefore if there are no files on the state, we will prompt the user to name one file that can be added to the project.
We explain that at least one file is required otherwise there is nowhere to create any blocks and no way to proceed.
We then create this as an empty file if it does not already exist by calling add_projfile() with the path.
Note that this function may fail, in which case it will return 0.
If it fails, we just loop until it succeeds as there's no going forward without it.

Next, if there is a file in projfiles that doesn't have a language set, then we tell the user that this is required and set the language on the projfile in this case.
We tell them that the language must be either "Python" or "C", and determines how blocks start and also where the comment part ends and code part starts.

Once we have set all the required conf vars, if any of them were missing, including any languages on the projfiles, or adding the first projfile, then we call save_conf() which just rewrites the conf file.

/* handle_edited_file

Here we are given a tmp file containing new contents of a block.

Every block belongs to a projfile, and the blocks are in order of the projfiles (set up in the conf file).

What we must do is replace the existing block contents with the new contents of that tmp file, and then write everything out to a new file on disk called a rev for the particular projfile that contains that block.

We already have on state all the current values of the blocks, which are spans that point into inp.
First we want to fix inp to reflect the new reality, and then we will write out the new disk file from inp (our global input span).
We will also fix the contents spans of all of the files starting with this one, and including all later ones.

We get the span corresponding to the current block, which is also the edited block, in a local variable for convenience.
We can do the same for the .contents of the file, calling file_for_block to get the index.

The contents of inp are already correct, up to the start of this block, which is what we want to replace.
Now we get the size of the tmp file and compare it to the len of the existing block (recall that len(span) exists and is one of our most commonly used library methods).
If it is larger, we need to move the contents after it (in inp) to the right in memory, if smaller, to the left.
We can do this using memmove.

Once we have done this, we have everything correct in inp except for the contents of the file itself, and we have a space that's sufficient for the file contents to be read into.
We construct a span that represents this space.
This span starts at the .buf of the original block, but has the length of the file.

We have a library function, span read_file_into_span(char*,span), which takes a span and reads a file into a prefix of that span, and then returns that prefix as another span.
We can pass our "gap" span representing the part of inp that we want to replace to this function, along with the filename.
We can confirm that the span that is returned is in fact the identical span as the buffer we passed in, since we are expecting that the file length has not changed.

As usual, if this expectation is violated we will complain and exit (using our exit_with_error(char*) convenience function).

Now inp is representing the new state of the project.

However, the file[i].contents for the files including and subsequent to this one may be incorrect.
Specifically, the difference in length of this block must be added to the .end of the file contents span for this file, and to both the .buf and .end of every subsequent file.

As a sanity check, after this step, we could validate that the .end of the last file is equal to the .end of inp itself.

We need to update the blocks, since any blocks after and including this one may have moved, so we call find_all_blocks().

Then we call a helper function, new_rev, which takes the filename and the file index for the projfile that was altered.
This function is responsible for storing a new rev, cleaning up the tmp file, and any reporting to the user that we might do.
We include a forward declaration here for new_rev.

Here we store a new revision, given a filename which contains a block that was edited and the index of the projfile that contains that block.

Our conf var revdir tells us where to put the new file that we are going to write.
We don't assume that the conf var ends in a slash, so we test for that and handle both cases.

First we construct a path starting with revdir and ending with an ISO 8601-style compact timestamp like 20240501-210759.
We then write the contents of the projfile (which has already been updated) into this file (the "rev") using write_to_file().

We create a copy of this file at the path for the projfile.
The file there which may have been edited and contain unsaved changes by some other process.
So we have a helper function, update_projfile, which takes the projfile index, the path of the rev file, and handles all of this.

/* #compile()

In compile(), we take the state and execute buildcmd, which is a config parameter.

First we call ensure_conf_var(state->buildcmd), since we are about to use that setting.

Next we print the command that we are going to run and flush, so the user sees something before the compiler process, which may be slow to produce output.

Then we use system(3) on a 2048-char buf which we allocate and statically zero.
Our s() interface (s(char*,int,span)) lets us set buildcmd as a null-terminated string beginning at buf.

We wait for another keystroke before returning if the compiler process fails, so the user can read the compiler errors (later we'll handle them better).
(Remember to call flush() before getch() so the user sees the prompt (which is "Build failed, press any key to continue...").)

On the other hand, if the build succeeds, we don't need the extra keystroke and go back to the main loop after a 1s delay so the user has time to read the success message before the main loop refreshes the current block.
In this case we prt "Build succeeded" on a line.

(We aren't doing this yet, but later we'll put something on the state to provide more status info to the user.)

In replace_code_clipboard, we pipe in the result of running state->cbpaste.

First we call ensure_conf_var with the message "Command to get text from the clipboard on your platform (Mac: pbpaste, Linux: try xclip -o -selection clipboard, Windows: ???)".

This will contain a command like "xclip -o -selection clipboard" (our default) or "pbpaste" on Mac, and comes from our conf file.

We use the cmp buffer to store this data, starting from cmp.end (which is always somewhere before the end of the cmp space big buffer).

The space that we can use is the difference between cmp_space + BUF_SZ, which locates the end of the cmp_space, and cmp.end, which is always less than this limit.

We then create a span, which is pointing into cmp, capturing the new data we just captured.

We call another function, replace_block_code_part(span) which takes this new span and the current state.
It is responsible for all further processing, notifications to the user, etc.

Note: when this function returns, cmp.end is unchanged.
This invalidates the span we created, but that's fine since it's about to go out of scope and we're done with it.

/* #replace_block_code_part(span)

Here we get a span (into cmp space) which contains a new code part for the current block.

Note: To get the length of a span, use len().
Note: Do this every time, not the just the first time.

Similar to handle_edited_file() above, we are given a span (instead of a file) and we must update the current block, moving data around in memory as necessary.

We put the original block's span in a local variable for convenience.

The end result of inp should contain:
- the contents of inp currently, up to the start (the .buf) of the original block.
- the comment part of the current block, which we can get from block_comment_part on the current block.
- up to two newlines unless the block comment part already ends with them
- the code part coming from the clipboard in our second argument
- current contents of inp from the .end of the original block to the inp.end of original input.

So, first we check whether we are adding one, zero, or two newlines, being careful about SEGV.
We get the index of the projfile from file_for_block.
Then we check the length of what the new block will be (comment part + opt. newlines + new part).
We then compare this to the old block length and do a memmove if necessary on the "rest" of inp, so that we have a gap to accommodate the new block's len.
Then we simply copy any newlines and the new code into inp.
(We do not need to copy the comment part, as it is already there in the original block.)

We then must update the .end of the current file contents, and both the .buf and .end of all subsequent projfiles, since the block length may have changed and therefore the file contents lengths will have also changed.

As before we then find the current locations of the blocks.

Once all this is done, we call new_rev, passing NULL for the filename argument, since there's no filename here.
